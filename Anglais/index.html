           <h2>Présentation</h2>
           <p>My name is Yanice Bouktab, born in Saint-Louis, I'm 20 years old and currently in my 1st year of BUT Réseau et Télécommunciation at the IUT in Colmar.
             I went through a seconde générale and a première and terminal STI2D option Architecture et Construction. After the B.U.T I'd like to go to engineering 
             school.

           <h2>Passions</h2>
           <p>Outside my studies, I like to play video games and go out with my friends. I've been playing soccer since I was 5, and my brothers, my father, 
            my uncles and my cousins all play soccer. I really love doing this sport because first of all it keeps me fit, but it also allows me to push 
            my limits and train until I reach my goals. It's given me that mentality that, in any field, there's always a way to reach your goal.
            I repeated my seconde and terminale but I really wanted to do a BUT RT in Colmar so I took on a personal math teacher and motivated myself to revise 
            regularly and today I'm there.
